## [2.6.0] - 2025-08-02 - "Portable Edition" 🚀

### 🎯 Major Release - Complete Portability Implementation

This release transforms CES into a fully portable system that can be installed as a drop-in subdirectory in any project without modifying host project files. CES now works seamlessly when cloned as `projectdir/ces/` with complete path auto-detection and cross-platform compatibility.

### ✨ Added

#### 🚀 Complete Portability System
- **Dynamic Path Resolution**: PathResolver utility with auto-detection of CES installation location
- **Portable Initialization**: New `init.sh` script that auto-detects installation type and configures paths
- **Installation Type Detection**: Supports both subdirectory (`projectdir/ces/`) and standalone installations
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS with normalized path handling
- **Environment Variable Support**: CES_ROOT and PROJECT_ROOT for flexible execution contexts

#### 🔧 Advanced Path Management
- **PathResolver Utility Class**: Singleton pattern with comprehensive path detection strategies
- **Multiple Detection Methods**: Module location, marker files, package.json, environment variables
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust detection with multiple strategies for reliable operation
- **Path Validation**: Automatic validation of detected paths with essential file checks

#### 📜 Shell Script Portability
- **Portable Headers**: All shell scripts updated with CES_ROOT auto-detection
- **Environment Detection**: Scripts automatically detect and export CES_ROOT and PROJECT_ROOT
- **Backward Compatibility**: ces-init-private.sh converted to wrapper forwarding to init.sh
- **Script Updates**: quick-setup.sh, version-bump.sh, ces-register-session.sh, ces-clean-reset.sh

#### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing
- **PathResolver Unit Tests**: 17 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
- **Portability Test Suites**: test-portability.sh and test-portability-simple.sh
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Path normalization and platform-specific handling tests
- **Integration Tests**: Configuration loading and environment detection validation

### 🔄 Changed

#### 📊 Enhanced Configuration System
- **EnvironmentConfig Integration**: Complete integration with PathResolver for dynamic paths
- **Portable Path Resolution**: All configuration paths now dynamically resolved
- **Installation Metadata**: Enhanced metadata with path detection information and installation type
- **Configuration Methods**: New getCesRoot(), getCesPath(), getProjectPath() methods

#### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- **Type-Safe Path Handling**: New interfaces for PathDetectionInfo and CESPaths
- **Singleton Pattern**: PathResolver implements singleton for global access
- **Method Standardization**: Consistent path resolution across all components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed detection information

### 🐛 Fixed

#### 🔧 Path Resolution Issues
- **Hardcoded Path Dependencies**: Eliminated all hardcoded paths preventing subdirectory installation
- **Shell Script Context**: Fixed execution issues when scripts run from different directories
- **Configuration Loading**: Resolved relative path resolution problems in different contexts
- **Cross-Platform Paths**: Fixed Windows/Linux/macOS path compatibility issues

### 🚀 Portability Features

#### ✅ Installation Examples
```bash
# Subdirectory Installation (NEW)
cd my-project
git clone <repo> ces
cd ces && ./init.sh

# Standalone Installation (EXISTING)
git clone <repo> ces-project
cd ces-project && ./init.sh
```

#### 🎯 Drop-in Compatibility
- Works immediately when cloned as subdirectory
- No modification of host project files required
